<h3>Tasks to try for improvement</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reorganize so every file besides .json is in a src file</li>
  <li>For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button</li>
  <li>Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them</li>
  <li>Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order</li>
  <li>When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw)</li>
  <li>Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list</li>
</ul>
